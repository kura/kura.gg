To my surprise I have found that there are still people out there who
use *"more"*, this has shocked me.

So this is a very, very short blog post to tell those who visit that
**less is more and more is less**.

What?
-----

less is a command that comes as standard in almost all Linux distros
now, and unlike more it actually has the ability to do backwards and
forwards scrolling with Page Up, Page Down, arrow keys and spacebar.
It's a fantastic little command!

.. code-block:: bash

    less FILE

Very simple to use and an all round great tool. The best thing about
less is it doesn't need to read the whole file in one go, it reads in
chunks. Opening a 100MB log file is simple with less!
