Today news arrived that broke my heart, Ian Murdock has passed away. I never
met Ian but he had an enormous impact on my life, through his work.

Debian has been my operating system of choice for many years now, it runs on
all of my servers and my home computers. Ian's vision for the operating system
is why I started using it and use it to this day. It's why I've continued to
work on the operating system and create packages of all of my work for it.

Ian is, without a doubt, one of the biggest influences on my career and on my
life.

Farewell sir, you will be missed.
