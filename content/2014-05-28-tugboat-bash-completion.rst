Notes
=====

It's worth noting that any command that supports a FUZZY_MATCH will take a
small amount of time to respond, due to querying the API for a list of either
droplets or images.

Commands that do a droplet lookup;

- destroy
- halt
- info
- password-reset
- rebuild
- resize
- restart
- snapshot
- ssh
- start
- wait

An image lookup;

- destroy_image
- info_image
- rebuild
