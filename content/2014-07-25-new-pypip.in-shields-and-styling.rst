Supported Python versions
=========================

This one is generated from the list of classifiers you provide to PyPI.

If no Python version classifiers exist, it defaults to Python 2.7. This is
because really, Python 3 is not widely used in production or supported by
libraries.

Python implementation(s)
========================

I think this one is really cool. Chances are you're unlikely to get more than
two supported implementations, like CPython and PyPy or CPython and Stackless.

The shield uses the Python implementation classifiers to generate this shield.
It supports all classifiers that PyPI supports (CPython, Jython, Iron Python,
PyPy and Stackless) and defaults to CPython is none are set.

Styling changes
===============

This change is simply because of the upgrade of the shields library. This
allows us to use the default rounded badges like below.

But also allow you to use a much nicer, cleaner, flat styling like the ones
used on this page.

SVG > PNG
=========

The final change is that by default pypip.in now returns SVG images by default,
rather than PNG. You can of course get the badge in whatever format you wish.
