Introduction
============

I'd like to introduce Ghastly, a clean and minimal, lightweight theme for the
`Pelican <https://getpelican.com>`__ blogging platform.

Ghastly is based heavily off of Casper, the default theme for
`Ghost <https://ghost.org>`__.


It's name is derived from the D&D monster, the Ghast and Gastly, the
Pokémon.
