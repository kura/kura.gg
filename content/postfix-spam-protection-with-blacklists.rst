This really should be quite a quick and simple post.

I use several tools to protect my mail servers from spam, the most
effective of these I've found is using external lists in conjunction
with **reject_rbl_client** and **reject_rhsbl_client**.

The description for each of these services was shamelessly taken from
Wikipedia, I have listed the services that I actually use but you can
find a much larger list on the `page that I took the descriptions
from`_.

.. _page that I took the descriptions from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists

***Please note that the SORBS lists are generally classed as being
aggressive and a lot of people advise not to use them due to this. They
have been known to block emails from senders like Facebook.***

You can pick and choose which ones you use and you configure them as
below within **smtp_recipient_restrictions** in **/etc/postfix/main.cf**

::

    smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
      reject_rbl_client zen.spamhaus.org,
      reject_rbl_client dnsbl.sorbs.net,
      reject_rbl_client spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net,
      reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net,
      reject_rhsbl_client rhsbl.ahbl.org
