Changes
=======

This patched version is built using the `USE_ZLIB` option, allowing for usage
of compression or using haproxy as a compression offloader.

Requirements
============

haproxy requires openssl-1.0.1d or higher.

On a standard Debian 7 install you should have openssl-1.0.1e-2, you
can find which version you have by running

.. code-block:: none bash

    dpkg -l openssl

This should return something similar to

::

    ii  openssl        1.0.1e-2        amd64        Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools

Build notes
===========

Builds were done on Debian 7 AMD64, I will not be providing 32bit versions as
this is mainly for my own usage and amusement.

This haproxy build is compiled against openssl, providing the npn module,
allowing for haproxy to work under SSL/TLS and allowing the use of SPDY/2 and
SPDY/3.

This version is available on `apt.kura.gg </apt.kura.gg/>`__
