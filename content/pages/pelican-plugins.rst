Themes
======

Eevee
-----

Eevee is a theme for `Pelican <https://getpelican.com>`_, based on Google's
`Material Design <https://material.google.com/>`_ specification.

It is named after the Pokémon `Eevee
<https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokedex/eevee>`_ because -- like the Pokémon Eevee
-- it can evolve in to many 'elemental types.'

`/eevee </eevee/>`_

Ghastly
-------

A clean and minimal, lightweight theme for the
`Pelican <https://getpelican.com>`_ blogging platform. Ghastly is based
heavily off of Casper, the default theme for `Ghost <https://ghost.org>`_.

`/ghastly </ghastly/>`_

Hauntr
------

Hauntr is a minimal, lightweight and clean theme for the
`Pelican <https://getpelican.com>`_ blogging platform.

It is named after the Pokemon 'Haunter' because it is a modified version
(you might say evolved) of my previous theme, `Ghastly
</ghastly/>`_.

`/hauntr </hauntr/>`_
