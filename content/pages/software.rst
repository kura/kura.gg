Blackhole
---------

Blackhole is a fake MTA (mail transfer agent) that is designed blindly accept,
bounce or reject all inbound and outbound email without actually processing or
storing any of the data. This makes it safe for handling large volumes of
email messages.

Blackhole is designed mostly for testing purposes and can be used to test numerous things suchs as;

- Email send rates, if you need to test how much mail you can send per minute, hour etc
- Email integration testing and finally
- if you work in the real world, chances are you’ll need work on a copy of production
  data from time to time. You can try to anonymous all the data but there is always a chance
  you’ll miss something. Configuring blackhole as your applications default SMTP gateway
  will remove any chance of a real person receiving an email they shouldn’t have received.

It is available as source and as SaaS.
