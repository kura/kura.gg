Introduction
============

I'd like to introduce Ghastly, a clean and minimal, lightweight theme for the
`Pelican <https://getpelican.com>`__ blogging platform.

Ghastly is based heavily off of Casper, the default theme for
`Ghost <https://ghost.org>`__.


It's name is derived from the D&D monster, the Ghast and Gastly, the
Pokémon.


Features
========

- Disqus
- Pygments
- CSS & JS minifying using webassets
- Share buttons
- Custom 404 page

Missing Features
----------------

- Templates are free from all tracking engines like Google Analytics,
  although adding tracking is as simple as editing the HTML.

Design concessions
==================

The Casper theme is designed purely for blog posts and as such it is hard
to easily create any kind of menu for it without ruining the overall design.

I continued this with Ghastly because to me, the articles are more important
than a menu.

This does mean pages become quite pointless.

Typography
==========

The guys at `Carrois <https://dev.carrois.com/fira-3-1/>`__ created FiraSans for
Mozilla and released it to the world for free.

The Ghastly theme uses both FiraSans for general typography and FiraMono for
`code`, `kbd`, `pre` and `samp` blocks.

    This is an example of the FiraSans font
