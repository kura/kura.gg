Blurb
=====

Brit in late 20s, worked in the tech industry for a good many years now.
Started programming when I was about 11 or 12, I say programming but the first
thing I learned to do was use one of the old Java-based website builders.
Shortly after learning to do this I started experimenting with writing the
HTML and CSS by hand and it snowballed from there.

My love for the OSS community grew from that point and I began working with
PHP, Python, Java and C. I also began experimenting with Linux around that
time.

Since then, programming and 'DevOps' has been a big passion of mine. Reading my
blog should show that I like to experiment with a lot of different pieces of
technology when I can and I enjoy giving back by writing about it, writing
guides and tutorials and participating in the community in general.

I'm currently a member of the Debian and Ubuntu package maintenance teams and
also run my own APT repository with custom packages of some well known OSS
projects and some of my own projects.

I am a proud Tor exit node operator. Operating around half a dozen exit nodes
that are linked to me and another dozen or so that are anonymous.

I have worked with several adult entertainment industry businesses for the last
4 years, helping provide high quality media at fast speeds. This work is all
done under an NDA. I am happy to sign an NDA and am not squeemish with content.

I have led a team, worked as a mentor and can happily fill multiple roles at
once. Often I am hired to do some programming, security-related stuff and fill
a DevOps role as well. I am also a capable architect and have designed and
built a lot of platforms over the years.

Languages
=========

I mostly tend to write in Python but am capable of picking up most languages as
needed. I can be left on my own to figure things out for myself and take it
from there.

Projects
========

This list has been cherry picked from the
`software page <https://kura.io/software/>`__ on my website.

MAP
---

MAP is a marketing platform that allows clients to create marketing campaigns
comprising of print, direct mail, email and SMS.

Blackhole
---------

`https://blackhole.io <https://blackhole.io/>`__

Blackhole is a fake MTA (mail transfer agent) that is designed blindly accept,
bounce or reject all inbound and outbound email without actually processing or
storing any of the data. This makes it safe for handling large volumes of email
messages.

Written to work with Python 3.5 utilising the asyncio standard library modules
and using the ``async def`` and ``await`` statements. Originally written for
Python 2.7 and earlier version of Python 3 and PyPy using the Tornado library.
