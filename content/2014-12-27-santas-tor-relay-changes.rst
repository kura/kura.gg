Exiting relays
==============

Both `SpunkWeasel (865A408E2B1EA3E18C9A12E80A8D458F9C985C16) <https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/865A408E2B1EA3E18C9A12E80A8D458F9C985C16>`_
and `AnorexicSquirrel (B8E6FFEB6F91FA3D26BC572836FB0ABBD142DC87) <https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/B8E6FFEB6F91FA3D26BC572836FB0ABBD142DC87>`_
have been given additional horsepower in terms of CPU and memory and both have
been allowed to exit. Additionally, both are now capable of IPv6 connectivity
as guards, relays and exits.

New relays
==========

A new exit relay has been put online called `VivaciousAlpaca (24B1783665A9B0A4BF640A1CD02F685C0CA098ED)
<https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/24B1783665A9B0A4BF640A1CD02F685C0CA098ED>`_.
It has the same CPU and memory as SpunkWeasel and AnorexicSquirrel and also
has full IPv6 capabilities.

A full list of my public Tor relays can be found on the `tor page
