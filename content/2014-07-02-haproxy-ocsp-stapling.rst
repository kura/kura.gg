With haproxy 1.5 finally being released we are lucky enough to get a basic
interface around OCSP stapling.

Sadly this interface really is quite basic and it's not the simplest thing to
figure out without some trial and error.

According to the official documentation, you should be able to pipe your
OCSP response to haproxy via it's stats socket. Sadly I could not get this to
work properly at all, so I decided to swap the piping for a file and reload
solution.

You'll need to get a copy of your certification authorities root certificate
to proceed with this.

Looking for your OCSP URI
=========================

If you don't know the URI you need to do an OCSP lookup against, you can find
it in your certificate data.

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl x509 -in /path/to/your/certificate -text

Inside the output, look for the following section.

::

    Authority Information Access:
        CA Issuers - URI:https://secure.globalsign.com/cacert/gsdomainvalsha2g2r1.crt
        OCSP - URI:https://ocsp2.globalsign.com/gsdomainvalsha2g2

Testing OCSP response
=====================

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl ocsp -noverify -issuer /path/to/your/ca/root/certificate \
                 -cert /path/to/your/certificate -url "OCSP_URI"

You should see a response like the one below.

::

    /path/to/your/certificate: good

If you get any errors from this, you may need to try these additional arguments;

Disable nonces
--------------

::

    -no_nonce

This will disable nonces, some servers are not able to handle nonces so you may
need to disable them.

Send a "Host" header
--------------------

If you get an HTTP status like a 403 or 404 then you may need to specify
a host header.

::

    -header Host OCSP_URI_DOMAIN

For my certificate the OCSP URI is *https://ocsp2.globalsign.com/gsdomainvalsha2g2*
so the Host header would be like below.

::

    -header Host ocsp2.globalsign.com

Proving OCSP data to haproxy
============================

If the above testing was all OK, we can now actually use the data.

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl ocsp -noverify -issuer /path/to/your/ca/root/certificate \
                 -cert /path/to/your/certificate \
                 -url "OCSP_URI" -respout /path/to/your/certificate.ocsp

One thing to note is, if your certificate file is */etc/ssl/certs/kura.gg.crt*
then you must set -respout to */etc/ssl/certs/kura.gg.crt.ocsp*

You can now simply reload haproxy and check your OCSP staping is working.

Testing OCSP from haproxy
=========================

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl s_client -connect domain.tld:443 -tls1 -tlsextdebug -status

Near the top of the response you'll see your OCSP information.

::

    OCSP response:
    ======================================

Updating OCSP
=============

The simplest way of doing this is by using cron.daily or something similar
to update your certificate.ocsp file.
