**The command below no longer works, for an updated version that does
work and should continue to work (until you upgrade to a new distro
version e.g. 10.04 -> 12.04) please see `here`_.**

Really simple, should work for most cases, I've not found anything wrong
with it.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install '?and(~U,~Asecurity)'
