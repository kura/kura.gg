I have been a frequent audience member of `DJUGL <https://www.djugl.org/item/443153>`_
for a few years now and spend most of the time asking questions,
playing devils advocate and generally being my annoying self.

I have repeatedly said I would do a talk but never got round to it
until `Jon <https://twitter.com/JonWebJobs>`_ basically forced me
to get round to it.

My talk was on `blackhole/blackhole.io <https://blackhole.io>`_ and
covered several topics including `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`_,
`SimpleMTA </simplemta/>`_ and moved on to talking
about spamming and starting work on my honey pot suite called
`Nectar <https://nectar.blackhole.io>`_.

You can find the slides on `Speaker Deck <https://speakerdeck.com/kura/djugl-june-2013>`_,
sadly I ran out of time when creating them and although I was
promised time to finish them at work, I got busy. So I replaced
content with "Taylor Replacements(tm)".

The event, attendees and other speakers are listen on the `Lanyrd
event page <https://lanyrd.com/2013/djugl-june/>`_.

Several people took photos of the event, I don't remember who they
were to give them credit but you can view them below.

Unsurprisingly I was the only speaker at the event that
didn't have a Mac. I have a ginormous Alienware M17x R3 running
Linux.
