Introduction
============

With the release of my `Eevee </eevee/>`_ theme for Pelican, I realised
displaying a thumbnail image of the theme that linked to a larger image wasn't
the most appealing design choice. I prefer to leave Javascript out of the
equation where possible, being one of those weird people that have it disabled
by default.

As such I sought out a way to create a pure CSS equivalent of a Lightbox and
turn it in to an RST directive to plug directly in to Pelican.
