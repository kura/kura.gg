If you're an Python developer that uses Ubuntu or even Debian, you have
probably heard of Felix Krull's `deadsnakes
<https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes>`__ PPA.

I find myself using it a lot and since I tend to destroy my environments quite
frequently, I thought I'd save myself some time and write a simple
shell script to install the PPA, the versions of Python I frequently use and,
after messing up a machine -- ignore the existing version of python.

Gist removed. Sorry.
