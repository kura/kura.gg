24 hours of SSH attacks against a single server, visualised on a world
map using Python.

When a country stays lit up for more than 1 tick of the clock in the
left hand corner it means that multiple attacks are happening from
different IP addresses. An attacker is banned after;

-  1 failed root login,
-  3 failed user logins (including invalid users) and
-  3 failed system logins.
