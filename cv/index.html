          <p class="resume-item-copy"><p>MAP is a marketing platform that allows clients to create marketing campaigns comprising of print, direct mail, email and SMS.</p>
<p>I architected and designed most of the system and wrote the email and SMS send engines, the tracking system and the analytic system using Python/PyPy, Tornado, Pika, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ.</p>
<p>I was also responsible for building the server architecture and building many of the proof-of-concepts and finalised modules.</p>

          <p class="resume-item-copy"><p>Blackhole is a fake MTA (mail transfer agent) that is designed blindly accept, bounce or reject all inbound and outbound email without actually processing or storing any of the data. This makes it safe for handling large volumes of email messages.</p>
